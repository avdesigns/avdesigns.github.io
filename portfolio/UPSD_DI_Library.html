    <p>As the sole middle school library staff member, I designed the school’s library website.</p>

    <p>Challenge: The school library had three separate websites: one for the main content, one for the online databases, and one for the online catalog. The catalog requires a third-party address, but the other two could merge.</p>

    <p>Solution: I chose to use the Google Suite collection which integrated seamlessly with the organization’s Gmail accounts. Then I designed the website layout, chose the typography, and wrote the copy. Finally, I created three new Google Forms to organize the library’s many diverse inquires. I also wrote and established the circulation policy, collection development policy, and privacy policy. By consolidating resources, student knowledge and use of our online resources increased.</p>
